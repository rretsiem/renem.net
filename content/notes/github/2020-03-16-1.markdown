To publish images to [Pixelfed](https://pixelfed.org) (Fediverse), support for those instances would be a great addition. Since the [Pixelfed API](https://docs.pixelfed.org/technical-documentation/api-v1.html#authorization) is based on Mastodon V1 API, I hope that therefore not a complete new development is necessary. At least it sounds like a "low hanging fruit" :wink:

A possible use case would be to publish photos posts to Pixelfed instances and also enabling Webmentions to retrieve reactions to those posts.

If this is already possible with the "Mastodon" function, a hint on how to use it would be helpful.
