Thanks for the heads up. Sorry that I opened it and didn't search for the issues first. From the title lookup on the issue list, it wasn't clear to me that it is the same issue.

However, any glue why the _(Originally publishedâ€¦ )_ link in the opening comment here, points to the Issue-Tracker on Github and not to my [issue-note on my blog](https://renem.net/notes/github/2020-10-28-1/)? The log on Brid.gy has both URLs in the list. Should i open a new issue for this on Brid.gy?
