Since posting to fed.brid.gy works fine, I tried to repost a status on Mastodon today from my site. I used [Telegraph](https://telegraph.p3k.io/) to send the request and got a "202" back, so everything seems fine.

However the repost/reblog does not appear on my account [@renem.net@renem.net](https://fed.brid.gy/r/https://renem.net/) at Toots&Replies. Also the repost wasn't counted on the original status.
Here [is the log](https://fed.brid.gy/log?key=https%3A%2F%2Frenem.net%2Fnotes%2Freposts%2F2020-03-24-1%2F+https%3A%2F%2Fsocial.tchncs.de%2F%40kuketzblog%2F103877135239066914&start_time=1585047242) from fed.brid.gy for this repost-of action.

I don't know if this is the right channel to ask, or better via IRC, so I try it here first, but feel free to close this here and point me to the right "support channel". Thanks!
