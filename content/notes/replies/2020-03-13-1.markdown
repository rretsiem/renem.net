Interesting idea! Will not be used by me and I don't know if it's to specific for only one or two people. But thanks to the [#indieweb](https://indieweb.org/Micropub) all the needed techniques are already there.
Especially for static sites – like mine, which is Hugo powered – a constant rebuilding is time & resource intensive and could be a blocking point for such live updates.
